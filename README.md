## Trade-offs and Future Improvements

With more time, the following areas could be improved:

-   **Pagination/Infinite Scrolling:** For a large reading list, implement pagination or infinite scrolling to improve performance and user experience.
-   **User Authentication:** Implement user authentication to allow multiple users to manage their own reading lists.
-   **Image Uploads:** Instead of just storing a URL for the book cover, implement actual image uploads and storage (e.g., using a cloud storage service like AWS S3).
